## üöÄ Core Features

*   **Intuitive Dashboard:** A clean, responsive user interface to log actions and view progress.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis:** Actions are analyzed by Google's Gemini AI to provide an "intensity score" and personalized, encouraging feedback.
*   **Weekly Growth Suggestions:** The AI generates actionable, personalized goals for the user each week based on their activity.
*   **Gamification:** Earn achievement badges for milestones and compete on a weekly leaderboard to stay motivated.
*   **Secure Authentication:** End-to-end user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** The backend uses a job queue with Redis to handle AI analysis without slowing down the user experience.
